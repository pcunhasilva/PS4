# Explanation about the plots:
# The idea behind the plots is to understand the relationship between
# the popular votes and electoral college votes. In the first plot,
# we observe the evolution of both variables across different elections.
# We can note that when the percentage of popular votes increases, the 
# percentage of electoral college votes seems to increases too. In the 
# second plot (bottom right), we have a simple linear regression of 
# Electoral College margin on popular vote margin. The plot shows 
# a similar pattern to the one that we observe in the first plot:
# when the margin of popular vote increases, the difference between
# the winner and the loser increases in the Electoral College. This plot
# also shows the only cases in which a president received less popular votes 
# than the runner-up, the elected candidate was from the Democratic-Republican or 
# from the Republican Party.
# Finally, the last plot (bottom-left) presents the distribution of the 
# variable popular vote margin by parties. We observe that the lowest values
# of popular vote margin were received by the candidates from the  Republican
# party or other parties (Democratic-Republican or Whig). Moreover, we can observe that
# there is a larger variation in this variable for the Republican Party than for the 
# Democratic Party.
